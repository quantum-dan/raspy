# raspy
Python interface for HEC-RAS.  RAS + Python = raspy.

This is developed primarily for use with [raspy-cal](https://github.com/quantum-dan/raspy-cal), an automatic calibrator for HEC-RAS.  However, it could be used for any other HEC-RAS automation project.  See [PyRAS](https://pypi.org/project/PyRAS/) and the paper "[Application of Python Scripting Techniques for Control and Automation of HEC-RAS Simulations](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/10/10/1382)" for similar ideas.
